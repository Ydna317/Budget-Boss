# Budget-Boss

Budget-Boss is an application that helps keep track of your monetary gains and spendings. You can keep track of your income by cumulatively adding different income sources, whether it be work, gifts, pensions, etc. Additionally, you can keep track of spending as it decrements the set amount of money that you had input beforehand. 

This app also functions offline. As the application is used offline, your information will be stored within the local database until you have access to a connection where the app will then be able to take the information stored and save it to its accompanying online database.
